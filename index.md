        <p>
            Treasury’s Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT) is soliciting feedback on the addition of Federal Financial Management Standard Business Data Exchanges and Data Elements to the existing inventory to improve their accuracy and clarity of the federal financial system standards. This information will be used to determine what data elements are required in financial management systems to meet the Federal Financial Management System Requirements.
        </p>
     <p>
            Note: We are not requesting feedback to the elements previously defined in the existing inventory of FM Standard Business Data Elements, DATA Act Information Model Schema or the Fiscal Service Data Registry as part of this public comment period.

            FIT is the Line of Business Managing Partner for Federal Financial Management services. FIT has developed a
            set of reference documents that guide agencies in improving the cost, quality, and performance of
            Federal financial activities and solutions. Those references include:

        FIT has also identified business exchanges between agency mission support systems and the core financial system as an area of duplication and an opportunity for standardization across the government. 
        </p>
         <p>
           These business exchanges are designed for the same or similar business processes across systems, however the data elements used in the exchanges are often different. These business exchanges can be grouped by specific business events.  For example, the same standard can be used for a commercial invoice, travel voucher, or grants invoice. 
        </p>
     <p>
          The business exchanges that FIT has analyzed include:
        </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
                <a> The requisition business exchange occurs when the request to acquire goods or services is approved.  When a requisition is approved in the mission support system, a commitment is created in the financial system. 
            </li>
             <li>
                <a> The order business exchange occurs when the authorization to acquire goods or services is approved. When an order is approved in the mission support system, an obligation is created in the financial system.  
            </li>
          <li>
                <a> The invoice business exchange occurs when the quantities and costs of the goods or services provided by the seller.  Once the invoice has been approved, an outlay is created in the financial system.
            </li>
             <li>
                <a> The goods/service receipt business exchange occurs when the acknowledgement of having received goods and services for a specified quantity, amount, etc.
            </li>
             <li>
                <a> The entity information business exchange occurs on a regular basis between mission support systems and the financial system.  The information in this exchange includes information about entities interacting with the government.  This includes both payee and payer information needed to send or receive funds.
            </li>
                 <li>
                <a>The automated journal entry business exchange occurs when the mission support system initiates a financial transaction to be posted to the general ledger through an automated process (e.g., payroll batch upload). This does not include journal entries manually created or requiring human intervention to process.
            </li>
            </ul>

        <p>FIT also identified 527 FM Standard Business Data Elements which reflect the data elements needed to meet the
            requirements defined in the FFMSR. Included in this inventory are elements that have already been defined in
            either the DATA Act Information Model Schema (DAIMS) or the Fiscal Service Data Registry (FSDR):</p>
